javascript execution context i.e.
how does javascript run our codes
it is done using two phases
whenver we give any code to javascript
the first thing that is created is global execution context
and this is referred by this variable

global execution context
function execution context
eval execution context

{our js code}
the first phase is memory creation phase (creation phase)
second phase is execution phase

ex:
let val1=10
let val2=5
function addnum(num1,num2){
    total=num1+num2
    return total
}

let result1=addnum(val1,val2)
let resutl2=addnum(10,2)

step1:
global execution
allocated in this

step2:
memory phase
val1->undefined
val2->undefined
addnum->definition
result1->undefined
result->undefined

step3:
execution phase
val=10
val2=5
addnum-------new variable environment + execution thread (once its work is done it is deleted)
                memory phase: val1->undefined val2->undefined total->undefined
                execution context: num1->10 num2->5 total->15
the value of result1=15 is sent back to global execution context

result2-----new variable environment + execution thread
                memory phase: val1->undefined val2->undefined total->undefined
                execution context: num1->10 num2->2 total->12
result2=12
the value of result2=12 is sent back to global execution context

CALL STACK(LIFO)
same as other concepts in programming
